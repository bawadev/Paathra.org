- Always utilize available MCP servers (sequential thinking, context7 ect) as much as possible.
- Always use ShadCN components where applicable.
- Use Context7 MCP Tool to find applicable components and packages if you don't know about one. You can also use this to know about a library or a package.
- You can also use Serper and Fetch MCP Tools for something that Context7 can't satisfy.
- If the user provides a URL for a component or package then use the fetch tool to scrape it and use that.
- Maintain a list of used ShadCN components in ShadCN-context.md (make one if it doesn't exist). It should contain all the components used and reference this to check if you need to install a ShadCN component from scratch with the CLI tool or not
- Before moving into a new devlopment task, make sure to test and verify the current task is working
- Ask for help if you are stuck or unsure about something.
